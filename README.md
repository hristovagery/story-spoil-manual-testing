# Story Spoil Web Application - Manual Testing Documentation

This repository contains the documentation for the manual testing of the Story Spoil web application. It includes test cases and bug reports, documented in an Excel file.

### Structure of the Excel File:

* **Separate sheets for each Use Case:** Each sheet contains the test cases developed for a specific use case (manual execution), including Test Case ID, description, steps to reproduce, expected result, and test status (Pass/Fail).
* **Sheet "Bug Reports":** This sheet contains detailed reports for all identified bugs, including Bug ID, title, priority, severity, steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, and comments. The link between a bug and a test case is established through the "Case ID" column.

This documentation reflects a comprehensive manual testing effort.
